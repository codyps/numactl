Various simple test scripts to verify some parts of the NUMA API.

To do a full regression test run make test

You should have at least two nodes on a NUMA system for the test suite.

The tests in regress assume that there is enough memory free on nodes 0/1.
They consider PREFERRED/INTERLEAVE not hitting the first choice node an 
error. 

They also require a relatively idle machine to avoid too much
noise from memory allocation from other processes. Without
that regress1 might fail.

You can run the tests under valgrind with VALGRIND=valgrind make test
Older valgrind versions incorrectly report a uninitialized byte error
on set_mempolicy. That is a false positive.

TBD: more detailed unit tests for mbind / shm / {get,set}_mempolicy
Currently everything is tested using numactl only.
